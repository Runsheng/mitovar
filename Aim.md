## Aim and Scope:
### For mtDNA 
1. Assemble the full length mitochondrial DNA from DNA sequencing data, 
should be compatible with reads with different length, coverage and source, 
including 454, illumina and Ion reads.

2. Annotate the mtDNA sequencing, give the full annotation for protein genes, 
rRNAs and tRNAs. Highlight the Non-coding regions.

### For nuclear-encoded (mt)genes

1. Assemble the nulcear CDS sequences from the mix-stage RNA-seq data. Pick out
The best-fit orthology from Illumina RNA-seq data.
