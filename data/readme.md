## The dataset generated from the assembly of 14 nematode species
1. The [tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runsheng/mitovar/master/data/tree.newick) of the 19 *Caenorhabditis* species with *Pristionchus pacificus* as outgroup, built from the mtDNA-encoded protein sequences.
2. The [fasta alignment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runsheng/mitovar/master/data/mito_protein_aln.fa) of mtDNA-encoded protein sequences in these species.
3. The [benchmark result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runsheng/mitovar/master/data/benchmark_cbre.fasta) shows the assembly result of *Caenorhabditis brenneri* mtDNA with different pipelines.
